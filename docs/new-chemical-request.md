# New Chemical Request Process

Use this process for employees who need to request a new chemical without editing the SDS spreadsheet directly.

## Recommended Form Fields

```text
Location
Product
Reason
Requester
Notes
```

Keep the form short. The requester usually will not know the spreadsheet-specific SDS fields, so the form should only collect enough information for the correct location owner or supervisor to review the request.

## Power Automate Routing

The website has a built-in request form. Create one Power Automate flow with an HTTP trigger, then paste that trigger URL into `NEW_CHEMICAL_REQUEST_URL` in `site.config.js`.

```text
When an HTTP request is received
  -> Condition or Switch on Location
  -> Post message in a chat or channel
```

Route each location to the person or Teams channel responsible for that SDS spreadsheet.

## Teams Message Template

```text
Please add this product to the SDS spreadsheet:

Location: [Location]
Product: [Product]
Reason: [Reason]
Requester: [Requester]
Notes: [Notes]
```

The message is informational only. Do not add approve or deny buttons unless the workflow later needs formal tracking.
